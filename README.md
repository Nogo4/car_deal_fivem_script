   ```
3. **Configure** the script by editing `config.lua`
4. **Restart** your server

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the `config.lua` file to customize your dealership:

```lua
Config = {}

-- Available vehicles with their display names, model names, and prices
Config.vehicules_label_list = {"Sultan", "Schafter", "Stratum"}
Config.vehicule_model_name = {"sultan", "schafter6", "stratum"}
Config.vehicules_price = {12000, 7500, 8000}

-- NPC Dealer configuration
Config.concess_ped = {
    model = "IG_Paper",  -- NPC model
    pos = vector4(-38.7606, -1095.5828, 26.4223, 155.2164)  -- Position and heading
}

-- Vehicle spawn location for preview and delivery
Config.vl_spawn_pos = vector4(-44.6425, -1099.0203, 26.4223, 333.4960)
```

## üéÆ How to Use

1. **Approach the NPC** dealer at the configured location
2. **Press E** when prompted to open the dealership menu
3. **Browse vehicles** using the list - preview vehicles will spawn automatically

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Vehicles

To add new vehicles, edit the config arrays:
```lua
Config.vehicules_label_list = {"Sultan", "Schafter", "Stratum", "New Car"}
Config.vehicule_model_name = {"sultan", "schafter6", "stratum", "newcar"}
Config.vehicules_price = {12000, 7500, 8000, 15000}
```

### Changing NPC Location

Modify the `Config.concess_ped.pos` coordinates to move the dealer NPC to a different location.

### Customizing the Menu

The menu uses RageUI and can be customized by modifying the `cli_main.lua` file.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Vehicle not spawning after purchase?**
- Check that the vehicle model exists in your server
- Verify the spawn coordinates are not blocked

**Money not being deducted?**
- Ensure ESX is properly installed and running
- Check that the player has sufficient funds in their bank account

**NPC not appearing?**
- Verify the NPC model exists
- Check the coordinates in the config
